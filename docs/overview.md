# Overview

Meson is a mixnet for cryptocurrency transactions. The original vision was to be the mixnet for all Ethereum chains but due to popular demand from many blockchain projects, we will attempt a bigger vision. Meson is built on top of the Katzenpost software project. Katzenpost is a series of software libraries for building mixnets.
