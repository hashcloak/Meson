Development Meson uses the Katzenpost software libraries to build its software. Katzenpost is an open-source project funded by the EU. As such, we want to be able to give back and help make their software ready for production. The best way to help Meson is to help Katzenpost! Another way to help Meson is to contribute docs and code to our client libraries. We want our code to be easy to understand and integrate into projects so that they can get the nice properties of mixnets. Running a node The Meson network is composed of several kinds of nodes: authorities, providers and mixes. All of these nodes are important to the functioning of the network! If you want to learn more about all of these roles, head to our docs Research Mixnets are new technology, even though they have been proposed in past literature and have seen deployments for email-related applications. As such, Meson is also an experimental project and can help push how mixnets are used in the real world. There are a lot of research questions that we need to solve for Meson. To see what the questions we are actively trying to answer, head to our R&D project for more info. Donate Meson is a public good that can benefit all blockchain projects. As such, HashCloak doesn't charge for the use of any of the client libraries as this would impede the use of Meson. Although we are actively researching ways to make Meson self-sustaining, we are really early in the project. Donating is a great way to help us pay for various costs such as servers and developers. For now, you can donate any token at meson.eth .","title":"Contribute"},{"location":"contribute/#contribute","text":"There are several ways to contribute to Meson.","title":"Contribute"},{"location":"contribute/#development","text":"Meson uses the Katzenpost software libraries to build its software.

As such, in order to achieve our vision, we need a plan to get their. Here, we outline various things that we need to work on in order to make Meson the best mixnet it can be. Adding support for other chains Currently, Meson supports Ethereum-based transactions and has the ability to support Bitcoin-based transactions. We want to build Katzenpost plugins that can support other chains. On our immediate list are the following chains: ETH2.0 Cosmos Polkadot Handshake Adding support for Layer 2 projects Scaling is an important issue in the blockchain space, but often times, comes at the expense of privacy. We want to be able to support various L2 scaling schemes so that they, too, can benefit from the various anonymity properties of mix networks. On our immediate list are the following projects: Lightning Bolt Connext ZK Sync Fuel Easy Deployment of Meson Mixnet components Meson is made up of 3 kinds of nodes: Authorities, Providers and Mixes. These are components that need to be deployed separately. As such, we want to make it easy for anyone to deploy these components and participate in the network. We are working towards easily configurable deploy scripts and integrating into popular \"node-in-a-box\" providers like DAppNode and Avado. Integration into wallets In order for Meson to be useful, people need to use it. Towards this end, we want to integrate Meson client software into popular wallets and perhaps even build our own. This will enable anyone the ability to send cryptocurrency transactions over the Meson mixnet. Governance Even though this started as a HashCloak project, this is overall a blockchain community project. Thus, it needs to be governed by various and diverse stakeholders. Governance is a hard problem for all open source projects. We hope we can attempt to build a strong community of people who want to see a production working mix network for cryptocurrency transactions. The eventual goal is have Meson be its own nonprofit structure with accountability and transparency built-in. Contribute to Mix Network research Meson is an experimental project built on experimental software implementing an experimental anonymous communication protocol. Of course, we are going to help make this stuff a little less experimental by contributing to mix network research. On our immediate list, we want to work on the following research problems: A byzantine fault tolerant voting mechanism for the PKI Authority. Continuous tuning and parameterization of mix network parameters. A Path to Self-sufficiency We can't rely on donations and grants forever. As such, we want to find a way to self-sustain the development and maintainance of Meson. We will not do an ICO as there is no need for a token. The current ideas we have around this are: Payment channels Building a privacy-focused wallet","title":"Roadmap"},{"location":"roadmap/#roadmap","text":"We have a vision for Meson and that is to be THE mixnet for cryptocurrency transactions.
