# Specification

This contains the work-in-progress specification of various aspects of Meson.
As Meson is a fork of the Katzenpost Mixnet project, many of the components of Meson are shared with Katzenpost.
For completeness, we will include both specifications for components only related to Meson and the components taken from Katzenpost.
