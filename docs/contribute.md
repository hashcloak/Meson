# Contribute

There are several ways to contribute to Meson.

## Development
Meson uses the Katzenpost software libraries to build its software. Katzenpost is an open-source project funded by the EU. As such, we want to be able to give back and help make their software ready for production. The best way to help Meson is to help Katzenpost! 

Another way to help Meson is to contribute docs and code to our client libraries. We want our code to be easy to understand and integrate into projects so that they can get the nice properties of mixnets.

## Running a node
The Meson network is composed of several kinds of nodes: authorities, providers and mixes. 
All of these nodes are important to the functioning of the network!
If you want to learn more about all of these roles, head to our [docs](docs.md)

## Research
Mixnets are new technology, even though they have been proposed in past literature and have seen deployments for email-related applications. As such, Meson is also an experimental project and can help push how mixnets are used in the real world.

There are a lot of research questions that we need to solve for Meson. To see what the questions we are actively trying to answer, head to our [R&D project](https://github.com/hashcloak/Meson/projects/2) for more info.

## Donate
Meson is a public good that can benefit all blockchain projects. As such, HashCloak doesn't charge for the use of any of the client libraries as this would impede the use of Meson. Although we are actively researching ways to make Meson self-sustaining, we are really early in the project. Donating is a great way to help us pay for various costs such as servers and developers. 

For now, you can donate any token at `meson.eth`.
